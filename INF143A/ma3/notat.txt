To implement the HMAC using SHA-256, we need to follow the HMAC construction described 
in the lecture or in Applied Cryptography by Paar and Pelzl. The HMAC construction takes a hash 
function (in this case SHA-256) and a secret key, and produces a MAC.

This implementation takes a file containing the message to be authenticated, 
a file containing the secret key, and an output file where the MAC will be written. 
It then reads in the message and key, computes the HMAC using the hmac function, and writes
the resulting MAC to the output file.

To run this script, you would use the command python hmac_1.py 
file key output_file. For example, if your message is in a file called message.txt, 
your key is in a file called key.txt, and you want to write the MAC to an output file, 
you would use the command python hmac.py message.txt key.txt mac.txt
